# Pseudonymization

Here are the links to the resources and the current code: https://github.com/SamirYousuf/Pseudonymization (now forked and cloned at sancarder)
Pseudonymization guidelines from SweLL project are here: https://spraakbanken.github.io/swell-project/Anonymization_guidelines 

Note that the Pseudo-guidelines are under reviewing at the moment. 

Another word of caution is that the test essays have a tag ”country_of_origin” which we now decided not to keep but exchange for ”country”. 

Additional resources will be manually annotated essays and a sheet with an overview of their types and metadata.

The updated version can later be integrated into SVALA.
